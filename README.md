# GARCHmodel
GARCH model to predict stock volatility
## GARCH Model Basics 
GARCHâ€”The Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity model, as the name suggests, accounts for the change in the variance of returns over time, identifying non-constant volatility. 
### ARCH Model 
_ARCH(q): h<sub>t</sub> = b<sub>0</sub> + $\sum_{i=0}^q bi (u^2<sub>t-i</sub>)
